    "Song Speed of Sound: Spacy gave it a sentiment of 0.24 which is slightly positive, but more neutral. I believe this song has more of a negative connotation. I believe the sentiment differs because Spacy can't hear the undertones of the song and is taking certain words that may need a deeper understanding than ranking the words on polarity.\n",
